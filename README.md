Here's a beginner-friendly README.md file you can use for your Python Calculator Project, covering both the CLI and GUI (Tkinter) versions.

🧮 Simple Calculator in Python
This repository contains two beginner-friendly calculator applications written in Python:

✅ CLI Calculator – Command-line interface

✅ GUI Calculator – Built with Tkinter (Python’s built-in GUI library)

Both versions are under 100 lines of code and are great for learning basic Python concepts like functions, conditionals, user input, and GUI programming.

📁 Files
File	Description
cli_calculator.py	Basic calculator using CLI
gui_calculator.py	Calculator with a graphical UI
